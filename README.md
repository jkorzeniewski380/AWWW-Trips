# Trips Project

Application was created from [react-node-template](https://github.com/mattvukas/react-node-template).

## react-node-template

React Node Template is a simple, unopinionated, full stack web app template, with the goal of facilitating quick prototyping and deployment to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or elsewhere.

This template combines a **client** generated by `create-react-app` and a **server** generated by `express-generator`.

In local dev, the React dev server & Node server are run side by side, with API calls [proxied](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/) through the React dev server to the Node server. In production, the Node app will serve both the static React production build and the API.

This project can be deployed as is to Heroku; the `heroku-postbuild` script will generate a production build of the React app and the `start` script will kick off the Node server.

## Libraries
Libraries used on Frontend in the project:
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - making API requests
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)/[Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - form handling with validation
- [React-router](https://reactrouter.com/) - routing
- [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) - functional programming library
- [ImmutableJS](https://immutable-js.com/) - great immutable data structures, used to ensure immutability of redux state
- [edux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/)/[RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) - reactive actions handling
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)/[React-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)/[Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) - global state
- [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) - theme & CSS in JS functionality

## Local Dev Setup

All commands run from project root:

1. `cd src/client && npm install`
2. `cd src/server && npm install`
3. Create `.env` file in `src/server` directory and add environmental variables:
```bash
POSTGRES_USERNAME=<username>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<user password>
POSTGRES_DATABASE=<database name>
POSTGRES_PORT=<port>
```
4. `cd ../../ && npm install`
5. `npm run dev`

You will now see the output of both the React dev server and the Node server in your shell, running at the same time thanks to `concurrently`. Enjoy!

## Client<->Server Communication

The Node Express.js server is initialized with one router mounted at `/api`. The app is communicating with Postgres database using **Sequelize**; frontend is making requests to backend using **axios**.
